## Spark Practice

### Introduction

This repo contains example codes for practicing Spark.

I learnt from [Learning Spark 2.0](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf), which is a really good resource for starters.

The codes are contained in notebooks, covering:
* basic DataFrame manipulations
* read/write operations
* basic use of MLlib to predict the house price in California

### How to use?
* download the datasets: `./download.sh`
* run notebooks in `/notebook`
